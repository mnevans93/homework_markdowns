## Q1. How does the Internet work?
The internet functions through communications between users, servers, software, etc., in the form of requests and responses. Something will make a request and a response will be granted based on the request.

## Q2. What do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript do?
HTML makes up the fundamental building blocks of a website's structure. CSS is responsible for styling those blocks depending on the desired visual layout of the site. JavaScript adds a plethora of potential additional functionality, allowing a website to be more dynamic and responsive to users interacting with it.

## Q3. What is the difference between backend and frontend?
The frontend is everything that is associated with the immediate user experience, such as the HTML/CSS/JS that make up a website or web application. It is responsible for taking user requests and routing them to the backend, which is everything that goes on "behind the scenes" on a website or web application. For example, this includes things like databases for storing any number of things, such as user information, from which the backend will pull information to respond to the frontend request.
