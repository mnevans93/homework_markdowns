## Q1. What is Big O Notation?
**Big O Notation** is a convention used to describe the efficiency of algorithms in terms of both speed and space.

## Q2. What are Omega and Theta?
**Omega** describes the best-case result of any give algorithm at runtime, both in terms of speed and space, but it is usually not a very useful concept. **Theta** describes the average result that can be expected from an algorithm at runtime and is typically used as the benchmark for "real world" performance of an algorithm.

## Q3. What is an example of Linear Time Complexity?
Linear time complexity, also called O(N), describes an algorithm that scales linearly in terms of efficiency. A basic example of this is a forEach loop.
    
    const arr = [1, 2, 3, ... n]
    arr.forEach(element => {
        //do a thing to each element
    })
The larger the array, the longer the forEach will take. 

## Q4. What is an example of Quadratic Time Complexity?
Quadratic time complexity, also called O(N^2), describes an algorithm that scales exponentially in terms of efficiency. A common example of this is nesting loops.

    for (let thing = 0; thing < 10; thing++) {
        for (let secondThing = 0; secondThing < 10; secondThing++) {
            //doing stuff
        }
    }
For each nested loop, the time required to complete is exponential. I used 10 to make this easier to visualize. A single loop that requires 1 second to run, running 10 times, will equal 10 seconds. A nested loop as shown below requires 1 second times 10 times 10, or 100 seconds.
