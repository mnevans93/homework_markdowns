# Written Assignment #5
## ❓ Is Node.js a programming language? What is Node?
Node.js is not a programming language. It is a JavaScript runtime environment and library that allows for running JavaScript outside of a browser environment.

## ❓ Is Express a programming language? What is Express?
Express is not a programming language. It is a Node.js web application framework that handles HTTP routing, and it is very lightweight and thus high-performance.

## ❓ What is the primary reason why Node/Express applications are so performant?
They are event-driven and asynchronous which allows them to quickly execute code in direct response to client or server-side events.

## ❓ Is "...const el = document.getElementById('my-list');" a valid JavaScript statement in a Node app? Why or Why Not?
No, because by default there is no "document" object to which the Node app is attached. The JS essentially runs on its own, and doing DOM manipulation in Node.js requires different approaches. In a basic web app such as one with only index.html, style.css, and app.js, the links in the HTML file are what allow for these three documents to communicate with one another and form the DOM that allows for the developer to use "document.getElementByID" and other similar functions.

## ❓ What is a CRUD?
CRUD is an acronym which stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete/Destroy, describing the four basic functions required for operations on stored data such as that within a database.

## ❓ What does INDUCES stand for?
Index | New | Delete/Destroy | Update | Create | Edit | Show

## ❓ What is REST?
REST is shorthand for Representational State Transfer and refers to a fundamental web design principle in which the client and server exist without knowledge of one another, and instead of being linked in a way where one requires the other, they can simply send requests and responses back and forth that represent the state of data on either end. For example, a "GET" request from a client will not "GET" an actual database item and allow for direct manipulation but rather a list of info based on the properties of that database item. The client may then have options to send a "PUT," "DELETE," or other request with info representing the desired change(s) to the database item which the server then parses and, provided the changes are valid, updates the actual database item accordingly.

## ❓ What is a Model?
A Model represents how data is stored and organized within a database.

## ❓ What is JSX?
JSX is essentially syntactic sugar for function calls and is particularly useful in working with React. One of its many advantages with React includes it removing the need for the developer to type "React.createElement" for every single element they wish to display on a view. It allows a user to much more seamlessly combine JS and HTML as well.

## ❓ What is A View Engine?
A view engine allows for rendering web pages dynamically based on view templates.

## ❓ What is A Data Controller?
A data controller is what handles interaction with databases or other data storage locations on the back-end of an application. For example, a "GET" request would require accessing the data to pull info representing a particular object before sending it back to the client.

## ❓ What is A View Controller?
A view controller is responsible for rendering client-side views based on what types of requests and responses are being sent. Continuing the example in the above Data Controller question, a view controller would take the info requested by the "GET" and would render a specific view that displayed the info representing the database object using some kind of template such as "Show" or "Index."

## ❓ What is A Route Controller?
A route controller handles the routing of requests and the chaining of required functions to properly respond to the request. In the example from the above two controller questions, a data controller and view controller may exist independently from one another, and it would be the route controller's job to chain each controller's appropriate functions together to properly send the server response to the "GET" request.

## ❓ What is Express Middleware?
Middleware describes any additional software, libraries, etc., that are required to perform certain additional operations "in the middle" of the basic request/response cycle. One very common example is method-override which allows us to perform a number of additional methods or actions that are not supported by default, such as using a form object to send a PUT or DELETE request where natively they can only send GET or POST.

## ❓ Describe the MVC Diagram that we have been using in class?
The MVC diagram describes the entire flow of the request/response cycle. In particular, it shows the relationship between Node, Express, JSX/React, and Mongoose/MongoDB. The visitor to the site sends some kind of "Request" to the Node application which works in tandem with the Express server to respond to the request. Based on the type of request, Express may need React to generate a view for the visitor using a specific template, or it may need to connect to MongoDB to pull info from a database. Once Express has received the appropriate HTML from React and the data from MongoDB, it can send a "Response" to the client.
